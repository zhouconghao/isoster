# Multi-Band Isoster (Experimental)

> **Status: experimental.** Stage-1 (joint fit) shipped 2026-04-30; the
> Stage-3 backport campaign + Phase 39 finalization shipped 2026-05-04
> on `feat/multiband-feasibility`. API and output schema are subject

## Status: shipped vs not-shipped vs experimental

The table below tracks every Stage backport from single-band into the
multi-band path, plus the Phase 39 finalization. Use it to decide
whether the feature you want is available in this code path.

| Stage | Feature | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Joint multi-band fit (shared geometry, per-band intensities + harmonics) | ✅ shipped |
| A | `integrator='median'` for `intens_<b>` (decoupled mode) | ✅ shipped |
| B | `outer_reg_*` damping (Tikhonov, default `outer_reg_weights = {1, 0, 0}` — center only) | ✅ shipped |
| C | `lsb_auto_lock` family (matrix-mode lock, anchor capture, debounce) | ✅ shipped |
| D | `compute_cog` per-band curve-of-growth + `sky_offsets` post-hoc kwarg | ✅ shipped |
| F | `central_reg_*` (LSB-central geometry penalty) | ✅ shipped |
| H | Forced-photometry mode (`template_isophotes`) | ✅ shipped |
| H.1 | Post-hoc per-band harmonics in forced mode | ✅ shipped |
| I | ASDF I/O symmetry (`isophote_results_mb_to_asdf` / `_from_asdf`) | ✅ shipped |
| J | Parallel CLI (`isoster-mb` console script, separate from `isoster`) | ✅ shipped |
| 6 | Higher-order harmonic modes: `independent` / `shared` / `simultaneous_in_loop` / `simultaneous_original` | ✅ shipped (`simultaneous_*` carries an experimental warning) |
| E | `outer_reg_mode='solver'` (reference-pull solver mode) | ⏸ deprioritized — same failure mode as `{1, 1, 1}` damping default. Reactivate on user request. |
| G | `'adaptive'` integrator | ⏸ deprioritized — superseded by Stage-C `lsb_auto_lock`. |
| — | ISOFIT (`simultaneous_harmonics` flag from single-band) | ❌ not ported. The Section-6 `multiband_higher_harmonics` enum is the multi-band replacement. |

## Known limitations and gotchas

Read this list before running multi-band on real data. Most items are
real-data findings codified during the Stage-3 campaign and the
pre-merge review pass.

1. **`outer_reg_weights = {1, 1, 1}` over-pins on barred / spiral / BCG-ICL
   systems.** The Stage-B follow-up sweep on PGC006669 showed Tikhonov
   `α` saturates above 99.99 % for any positive eps / pa weight in the
   user-intuition range — the eps / pa choice is **binary, not graded**.
   Default flipped to `{1, 0, 0}` (center-only). Opt back into
   `{1, 1, 1}` only for confirmed-static outer envelopes (cD galaxies,
   isolated massive ellipticals).

2. **`lsb_auto_lock` is for cD / massive ellipticals only.** On barred /
   spiral targets the lock fires inside the disc (sma ~ 100 px, well
   before the LSB regime) and pins outer geometry to the bar shape. The
   MAD-based scatter metric does NOT catch this; visual QA on the
   comparison panel does. The field docstring carries the galaxy-type
   caveat.

3. **Forced-photometry mode silently ignores several iteration-only
   features.** `lsb_auto_lock`, `use_outer_center_regularization`,
   `use_central_regularization`, `harmonic_combination='ref'`,
   `loose_validity`, and `multiband_higher_harmonics ∈ {shared,
   simultaneous_in_loop, simultaneous_original}` are no-ops under
   forced extraction. The driver emits a `UserWarning` listing which
   features were dropped (review fix B2).

4. **Bender-normalized harmonics are required for interpretation.** Raw
   `a_n_<b>` / `b_n_<b>` values scale with local flux and are NOT
   directly comparable across bands or rings. Always plot
   `A_n_norm = -A_n / (a · dI/da_b)` per band. The repo plotting helpers
   enforce this convention (see `CLAUDE.md`).

5. **PSF-matched inputs assumed.** No PSF handling in the driver. If
   the per-band PSFs differ, isophotes whose SMA is comparable to the
   worst PSF FWHM will carry PSF-mismatch artifacts; the user must
   accept that or PSF-match upstream.

6. **Variance maps are all-or-nothing.** Either every band has one
   (full WLS) or no band has one (full OLS). Mixed-mode rejection at
   driver entry.

7. **`compute_cog`'s raw curve-of-growth dips past the LSB transition**
   on real data because the joint solver's `I0_b` carries residual sky
   (~ −1×10⁻³ e⁻/s on denoised cutouts, even after upstream
   sky-subtraction). Use the `sky_offsets` post-hoc kwarg on
   `compute_cog_mb` to apply an outermost-tail-derived offset before
   plotting `cog`/`r1/2`. Demos under
   `examples/example_asteris_denoised/` apply this explicitly between
   FITS write and QA plot generation; raw FITS files always preserve
   uncorrected `intens_<b>`.

8. **Single-band `integrator='median'` requires
   `fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False`.** The matrix-mode joint LS
   solve cannot host a median (non-linear). The validator hard-errors
   the combination at config construction with a remediation hint.

9. **Sample-validity is shared across bands by default.** A sample is
   dropped from the joint solve if any band's mask flags it, any band
   has NaN there, or any band's variance is non-positive. Set
   `IsosterConfigMB.loose_validity=True` to relax this — see the
   "Loose validity (D9 backport)" subsection below for per-band-drop
   semantics, the `n_valid_<b>` column, and the optional
   `loose_validity_band_normalization` knob.

10. **Forced-mode `intens_err_<b>` (OLS) uses unbiased sample std.**
    Review fix H4: `extract_forced_photometry_mb` returns
    `np.std(intens, ddof=1) / sqrt(n)` for the mean integrator and
    `sqrt(π/2) · np.std(intens, ddof=1) / sqrt(n)` for the median
    integrator (Gaussian-asymptotic median SEM). For `n < 2` the
    error is `NaN` rather than a misleading 0.0. WLS branch is
    unchanged — `1 / sqrt(Σ 1/var_i)` is the exact MLE error.

11. **Central-pixel `intens_err_<b>` reads the variance map under
    WLS** (review fix H3). In OLS mode (no variance map provided) the
    central-pixel record still reports `intens_err_<b> = 0.0` because
    a single sample admits no internal error estimate. `rms_<b>`
    stays `0.0` in both modes.

12. **`fit_image_multiband` does NOT mutate the user's
    `IsosterConfigMB`** (review fix H1). Internal resolution like the
    WLS / OLS variance-mode tag goes onto a `model_copy` so the
    caller's instance is safe to reuse across runs.

## What it does

`isoster.multiband.fit_image_multiband` fits elliptical isophotes
simultaneously on multiple aligned, same-pixel-grid images of the same
target (e.g. HSC g/r/i/z/y coadds). It produces a **single shared
geometry per SMA** with **per-band intensities and per-band harmonic
deviations**. This replaces the traditional forced-photometry workflow
("fit one band, apply the geometry to others") with a joint fit where
every band contributes to the geometry.

The joint design matrix per ellipse, B bands, N kept samples:

```
[ 1_g 0    0    sin(φ) cos(φ) sin(2φ) cos(2φ) ] [I0_g]    [intens_g]
[ 0   1_r  0    sin(φ) cos(φ) sin(2φ) cos(2φ) ] [I0_r]  = [intens_r]
[ 0   0    1_i  sin(φ) cos(φ) sin(2φ) cos(2φ) ] [I0_i]    [intens_i]
                                              [A1   ]
                                              [B1   ]
                                              [A2   ]
                                              [B2   ]
```

Free parameters: `(5 + B)` per ellipse (per-band background `I0_b` plus
shared geometric harmonic coefficients). Solved once per iteration in
WLS or OLS mode. Per-band weights `w_b` enter the joint normal
equations as a diagonal weight matrix: each band's row block
contributes `Aᵀ W A` with `W = diag(w_b)` in OLS, or
`W = diag(w_b / variance_<b>(pixel))` in WLS.

### Per-band intercept mode

The ``IsosterConfigMB.fit_per_band_intens_jointly`` boolean controls
how each band's per-isophote intercept ``I0_b`` (reported as
``intens_<b>``) is computed. The default ``True`` is the **coupled /
joint** mode described above: ``B`` per-band intercept columns sit in
the ``(B*N, B + 4)`` joint design matrix, so the per-band intercept
and the shared harmonic deformations are co-fit. On full rings the
sin/cos columns are mathematically orthogonal to the constant column
over ``[0, 2π]``, so the joint coefficient is numerically equivalent
to the per-band inverse-variance-weighted ring mean. On partial rings
(masking, loose validity), orthogonality breaks and the joint solve
absorbs the harmonic-shape coupling between bands when reporting each
band's intercept — this is where the joint mode adds information
across bands relative to a per-band ring statistic.

Setting ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False`` switches to a
**decoupled / ring-mean** mode: the leading ``B`` per-band intercept
columns are dropped from the design matrix; the solve becomes a
4-column shared ``(A1, B1, A2, B2)`` system. Per-band ``intens_<b>``
is then reported as the band's ring-mean intensity (IVW under WLS,
simple mean under OLS), independent of the harmonic fit, and
``intens_err_<b>`` is the band's own SEM. Use this when you want the
per-band intercept to be a clean ring statistic decoupled from the
harmonic block — for example, when you have already done a high-
quality sky subtraction upstream. Mutually exclusive with
``harmonic_combination='ref'`` (ref-mode bypasses the joint solve).

> **Integrator scope (Stage-3, plan section 7 S1–S2):** the
> ``integrator`` config field affects ``intens_<b>`` reporting at
> converged isophotes only in the **decoupled** intercept mode.
> ``integrator='mean'`` is unconditionally legal — both intercept
> modes give a (weighted) ring mean, numerically identical on full
> rings since ``sin(nφ)``/``cos(nφ)`` are orthogonal to the constant
> column. ``integrator='median'`` requires
> ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False``: the matrix-mode joint LS
> solve cannot host a median (non-linear), so the validator hard-
> errors on ``integrator='median'`` ∧
> ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=True`` with a remediation hint.
> Under ``integrator='median'`` the decoupled path replaces the
> per-band ring mean with a per-band ``np.median`` of the surviving
> ring samples (sample sigma-clipping has already been applied
> upstream by the sclip/nclip pipeline). Use this when partial-ring
> contaminants would pull a ring mean (e.g. faint companion sectors,
> diffraction spikes that the mask did not catch). The integrator
> field still also drives (a) per-band gradient computation and
> (b) the forced-photometry fallback for the central pixel.

Renamed in Section 6 cleanup from the deprecated
``fix_per_band_background_to_zero`` (with inverted polarity:
``fix_per_band_background_to_zero=True`` ↔
``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False``). The old field name is
rejected at config construction with a clear error pointing at the
new name; FITS files written by the new code carry only the new
name. The multi-band path is pre-production so we take a clean
break with no auto-translation.

## Performance

On the asteris denoised dataset (768×768 cutouts, 74 isophotes, all five
HSC bands), the joint multi-band fit runs in **~2× single-band wall
time end-to-end** (0.49 s for B=5 vs 0.25 s for single-band on i-band,
including FITS I/O). This is well within the Stage-1 quality bar of
≤2.5× and reflects two key optimizations: (1) the
``(B·N × (B + 4))`` joint design matrix builder is numba-accelerated
with a NumPy fallback (``isoster/multiband/numba_kernels_mb.py``);
(2) the driver pre-resolves image / mask / variance arrays once per
fit and threads them through every per-iteration sampler call instead
of re-allocating per call. See decision D19 in the plan doc.

## Public API

```python
from isoster.multiband import fit_image_multiband, IsosterConfigMB

config = IsosterConfigMB(
    bands=["g", "r", "i", "z", "y"],
    reference_band="i",
    band_weights={"g": 1.0, "r": 1.0, "i": 1.0, "z": 1.0, "y": 1.0},
    harmonic_combination="joint",  # or "ref" for reference-band fallback
    sma0=10.0, maxsma=384.0, astep=0.1,
    debug=True, compute_deviations=True,
)
result = fit_image_multiband(
    images=[g_image, r_image, i_image, z_image, y_image],
    masks=object_mask,                    # single ndarray broadcast or list per band
    variance_maps=[g_var, r_var, ...],    # all-or-nothing
    config=config,
)
```

### Command-line interface (Stage-J, ``isoster-mb``)

The multi-band path ships a **separate** console script ``isoster-mb``
(entry point ``isoster.multiband.cli_mb:main``). This is intentionally a
parallel CLI to the stable single-band ``isoster`` script: while the
multi-band path remains experimental the two CLIs do **not** share
implementation, so multi-band-specific fixes cannot regress the
single-band entry point. Argument layout mirrors single-band for user
familiarity (``--config``, ``--output``, ``--x0``, ``--y0``, ``--sma0``,
``--fix-center``, ``--fix-eps``, ``--fix-pa``, ``--template``) but
takes one positional FITS path per band plus a ``--bands`` flag.

The CLI prints an ``EXPERIMENTAL`` banner per invocation while in beta;
suppress with ``--quiet``.

```bash
# Joint multi-band fit (FITS output uses Schema-1 multi-HDU writer).
isoster-mb image_g.fits image_r.fits image_i.fits \
    --bands g r i --reference-band i \
    --config config.yaml \
    --output isophotes_mb.fits

# Forced-photometry workflow: fit a deep band first, reuse its geometry
# across every band in one call (more efficient than running single-band
# B times — see Stage-H above).
isoster image_i.fits --output template_i.fits --config single_band.yaml
isoster-mb image_g.fits image_r.fits image_i.fits image_z.fits image_y.fits \
    --bands g r i z y --reference-band i \
    --template template_i.fits \
    --output isophotes_mb_forced.fits

# Per-band masks / variance maps + WLS:
isoster-mb image_g.fits image_r.fits \
    --bands g r --reference-band g \
    --masks mask_g.fits mask_r.fits \
    --variance-maps var_g.fits var_r.fits \
    --output isophotes_mb.fits
```

The ``--config`` YAML accepts any field of
:class:`isoster.multiband.IsosterConfigMB`; CLI flags layer on top.
``bands`` and ``reference_band`` may be set in YAML in lieu of
``--bands`` / ``--reference-band``. Output extension drives the writer:
``.fits`` (Schema-1 multi-HDU), ``.asdf`` (Stage-I native tree), or
anything else (astropy ``Table.write`` of the per-isophote table).

## Input contract (placeholder)

- `images`: `list[ndarray]` of length B, all of shape `(H, W)`.
- `masks`: `None`, single `(H, W)` boolean ndarray (broadcast to all
  bands), or `list[ndarray | None]` of length B. `None` per band means
  "no bad pixels in that band."
- `variance_maps`: all-or-nothing. Either `None` (full OLS), a single
  `(H, W)` ndarray (broadcast), or a `list[ndarray]` of length B.
  NaN/inf values are replaced with `1e30` (near-zero WLS weight);
  non-positive values are clamped to `1e-30` (near-infinite WLS weight)
  with a `RuntimeWarning` advising the user to mask those pixels
  instead. The sanitization mirrors single-band semantics; users who
  want bad pixels excluded from the fit must add them to `masks` —
  sanitization alone does not drop samples.
- `bands`: list of strings, regex `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`, no
  duplicates. Strings appear verbatim as column suffixes (`intens_g`,
  `intens_r`, ...).
- `reference_band`: string in `bands`. Used for diagnostics only; does
  not affect joint geometry.
- `band_weights`: dict (every band as key) or list (length B) of
  positive finite floats. Default uniform 1.0.

## Output schema (Schema 1)

`fit_image_multiband` returns a dict with `'isophotes'` (list of dicts,
one per SMA) and the multi-band-specific top-level keys:

```
result['bands']                       : list[str]
result['multiband']                   : True
result['harmonic_combination']        : 'joint' | 'ref'
result['reference_band']              : str
result['band_weights']                : dict[str, float]
result['variance_mode']               : 'wls' | 'ols'
result['fit_per_band_intens_jointly'] : bool
result['loose_validity']              : bool
result['multiband_higher_harmonics']  : 'independent' | 'shared' |
                                        'simultaneous_in_loop' |
                                        'simultaneous_original'
result['harmonic_orders']             : list[int]    # default [3, 4]
result['harmonics_shared']            : bool          # True iff non-'independent'
```

Optional, present only when the caller post-processed with
``subtract_outermost_sky_offset``:

```
result['sky_offsets']  : dict[str, float]   # per-band offset that was subtracted
```

Each isophote row carries shared columns and per-band-suffixed columns:

- Shared: `sma, x0, y0, eps, pa, x0_err, y0_err, eps_err, pa_err,
  stop_code, niter, rms, valid, use_eccentric_anomaly, ndata, nflag,
  tflux_e, tflux_c, npix_e, npix_c`.
- Per band `<b>`: `intens_<b>, intens_err_<b>, rms_<b>,
  n_valid_<b>` (the last is the per-band surviving-sample count after
  sigma clipping; under shared validity it equals the shared `ndata`).
- Per band per order `<n>`: `a<n>_<b>, b<n>_<b>, a<n>_err_<b>,
  b<n>_err_<b>` for each `n` in ``harmonic_orders`` (default `[3, 4]`,
  extensible to `[3, 4, 5, 6]` etc.). Under non-``'independent'``
  ``multiband_higher_harmonics`` modes these per-band columns all
  carry the **identical shared value** across bands at every isophote
  (the joint refit / in-loop solve produces one shared coefficient per
  order). Per-band Bender normalization at plotting time scales the
  shared raw value by ``-1/(sma·|dI/da_b|)``, which still produces
  band-distinct curves because per-band gradients differ.
- Debug-only per band: `grad_<b>, grad_error_<b>, grad_r_error_<b>`
  when `debug=True`.

The FITS writer (`isophote_results_to_fits`) uses the existing 3-HDU
layout (`PrimaryHDU`, `ISOPHOTES`, `CONFIG`), with the CONFIG HDU
recording multi-band parameters (`BANDS`, `REFERENCE_BAND`, `BAND_WEIGHTS`,
`HARMONIC_COMBINATION`, `VARIANCE_MODE`, `MULTIBAND`) alongside the usual
single-band fields.

**ASDF I/O symmetry:** `isophote_results_mb_to_asdf(result, filename)` and
`isophote_results_mb_from_asdf(filename)` mirror the single-band ASDF
helpers and are the recommended interchange format for downstream
Python pipelines that already consume ASDF. The on-disk tree stores the
full result dict natively (no JSON workaround), preserving per-band
suffix columns (`intens_<b>`, `a3_<b>`, `cog_<b>`, …), the
`IsosterConfigMB` model dump, multi-band top-level keys, and optional
`lsb_auto_lock` / `lsb_locked` lock-state metadata. The reader
reconstructs an `IsosterConfigMB` (or returns `None` if the schema has
moved on, mirroring the FITS forward-compatibility contract). The
`asdf` package is an optional dependency; both helpers raise an
`ImportError` with install hint if it is unavailable.

**B=1 fallback:** when `len(bands) == 1`, `fit_image_multiband`
delegates to `fit_image` and returns the legacy single-band schema
unmodified, with an informational warning.

## Worked example

See `examples/example_asteris_denoised/run_isoster_multiband.py` for the
end-to-end Stage-1 demo: joint multi-band fit on the asteris denoised
HSC coadds of object 37484563299062823. The script loads all five HSC
bands of denoised cutouts, the existing object mask (built by
`build_object_mask.py` on the noisy cutout), and per-band uniform-
variance maps from the sigma-clipped sky RMS. It runs the joint
multi-band fit, writes a Schema-1 FITS result and the composite QA
PNG to `outputs/example_asteris_denoised/<id>/`, and prints a geometry
sanity check against the existing i-band single-band reference fit
(loaded from the same outputs directory).

Typical sanity-check output on object 37484563299062823:

```
geometry sanity vs i-band reference (median over valid rings):
  eps:  multi-band=0.123   i-band=0.118
  pa:   multi-band=139.65 deg   i-band=144.96 deg
```

The small offset between multi-band and i-band-only geometries is
expected: the joint fit pools harmonic-coefficient information across
all five bands, so the recovered `pa` is a band-weighted compromise
rather than the i-band-specific solution. The two are in family — a
real bias would manifest as a shift of several degrees or a larger
ellipticity discrepancy.

## Algorithm notes

### Joint design matrix (decision D2)

For one isophote with B bands and N kept samples, the joint solver
fits a single ``(B + 4)``-parameter least-squares system per iteration:

```
[ 1_g 0   0   sin(φ) cos(φ) sin(2φ) cos(2φ) ] [I0_g]    [intens_g]
[ 0   1_r 0   sin(φ) cos(φ) sin(2φ) cos(2φ) ] [I0_r]  = [intens_r]
[ 0   0   1_i sin(φ) cos(φ) sin(2φ) cos(2φ) ] [I0_i]    [intens_i]
                                            [A1   ]
                                            [B1   ]
                                            [A2   ]
                                            [B2   ]
```

Per-band weights `w_b` enter the joint normal equations as a diagonal
weight matrix `W` (each band's row block contributes `Aᵀ W A` with
`W = diag(w_b)` in OLS, or `W = diag(w_b / variance_<b>(pixel))` in
WLS). With B=1 and `w_b = 1` the joint solver reduces to the existing
single-band 5-parameter system bit-for-bit (verified by
`test_joint_solver_b1_matches_single_band_solver`).

### Combined gradient (decision D10)

The geometry-update math (Jedrzejewski 1987) requires a single radial
gradient. For multi-band the driver computes per-band gradients
separately and combines them with the same per-band weights:

```
gradient_joint = Σ_b w_b · grad_b / Σ_b w_b
σ²_joint       = Σ_b w_b² · σ_b² / (Σ_b w_b)²    (independent measurements)
```

Plugged into the standard geometry-update formulas; the gradient-error
gate (`maxgerr`) reads `σ_joint / |gradient_joint|`.

### Sample-validity rule (decision D9)

A sample on the ellipse is dropped from the joint solve if **any**
band's mask flags it, **any** band has NaN at that location, or
**any** band's variance is non-positive after sanitization. This
guarantees that every band's row block in the joint design matrix has
the same `N` samples, which the joint solve requires. Edge cases where
one bad band drops samples in all bands are a known revisit item.

### Sigma clipping (decision D9)

Each band is clipped independently against its own intensity
statistics; the surviving sample masks are AND-ed across bands and
applied uniformly. Reduces to single-band exactly when B=1.

### Loose validity (D9 backport)

When ``IsosterConfigMB.loose_validity=True`` (default ``False``), the
shared-validity AND is relaxed: each band keeps its own surviving
samples and the joint design matrix becomes block-diagonal in the
per-band intercept columns. The shared geometric coefficients
``(A1, B1, A2, B2)`` are still constrained jointly. A band that falls
below ``loose_validity_min_per_band_count`` (absolute count, default 6)
or ``loose_validity_min_per_band_frac`` (fraction of attempted samples,
default 0.2) at a given isophote is dropped from the joint solve at
that isophote — its ``intens_<b>``, ``intens_err_<b>``, and harmonic
columns are set to NaN, and the surviving bands still constrain the
shared geometry. The whole isophote is marked ``stop_code=3`` only
when fewer than 2 bands survive.

A new per-isophote column ``n_valid_<b>`` reports each band's actual
surviving-sample count (after the per-band sigma clip). The QA figure
auto-adds a small panel showing ``n_valid_<b> / n_attempted`` per band
when ``loose_validity=True``.

The optional knob ``loose_validity_band_normalization`` controls how
per-band sample counts feed the joint solve and the combined gradient:

- ``"none"`` (default): each band's row block contributes
  proportionally to its own ``N_b``; ``w_b`` multiplies every row;
  combined gradient is ``Σ w_b · grad_b / Σ w_b`` over surviving
  bands. Bands with more kept samples dominate.
- ``"per_band_count"``: each band's row block is renormalized by
  ``√(1/N_b)`` so its total contribution equals ``w_b`` regardless of
  ``N_b``; combined gradient is weighted by ``(w_b · N_b)``. Restores
  the user's "this band matters this much" mental model when
  per-band masks differ. Requires ``loose_validity=True``.

Loose validity composes cleanly with both ``harmonic_combination='ref'``
and ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False``.

### Higher-order harmonics modes (Section 6, locked 2026-05-02)

The ``IsosterConfigMB.multiband_higher_harmonics`` enum controls how
higher-order (n ≥ 3) harmonic deviations ``(A_n, B_n)`` are fit. The
default ``'independent'`` reproduces Stage-1 behavior bit-for-bit; the
other three values share higher-order coefficients across bands in
different ways. ``IsosterConfigMB.harmonic_orders`` (default ``[3, 4]``,
extensible to ``[3, 4, 5, 6]`` etc.) selects which orders are included
in any of the three non-``'independent'`` modes.

| Value | Where higher orders are solved | Cross-band coupling | Refits |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| ``independent`` (default) | Post-hoc, per band, per order via the single-band ``compute_deviations`` solver | None — each band independent | a3_b, b3_b, a4_b, b4_b ... |
| ``shared`` | Post-hoc joint solve over residuals | Shared (A_n, B_n) for n ≥ 3 across bands | (A_n, B_n) for n ≥ 3 only |
| ``simultaneous_in_loop`` | In every iteration's joint solve | Shared (A_n, B_n) for ALL n | (A1, B1, A2, B2, A_n, B_n) every iteration |
| ``simultaneous_original`` | 5-param in loop; one wider post-hoc joint solve over all orders | Shared (A_n, B_n) for ALL n | One post-hoc solve refits all orders |

#### `independent` (default)

Stage-1 behavior: at convergence, the driver calls
``_attach_per_band_harmonics`` which runs an independent
``compute_deviations`` per band per order. Each band's a_n / b_n
reflects its own ring's intensity, gradient, and noise. Per-band
``a_n_<b>`` and ``b_n_<b>`` typically differ across bands.

#### `shared` (NEW DEVELOPMENT)

Replaces the per-band post-hoc step with **one joint refit** of
higher-order coefficients shared across bands. The geometry-loop
values for ``(A1, B1, A2, B2)`` and per-band ``I0_b`` are frozen.
Design matrix is the smallest possible: ``(B·N, 2·L)`` where
``L = len(harmonic_orders)``. Per-band ``a_n_<b>`` columns all carry
the same shared value at every isophote. Errors come from the joint
covariance; per-band ``a_n_err_<b>`` is the same across bands too.

Astrophysical motivation: a multi-band joint fit is meant to produce
a single 1-D profile of the galaxy across bands; if the higher-order
geometric deviation genuinely differed band-to-band you should be
running ``harmonic_combination='ref'`` plus forced photometry instead.

#### `simultaneous_in_loop` and `simultaneous_original` (RECOVERED FEATURE)

Multi-band lifts of the single-band ``IsosterConfig.simultaneous_harmonics``
/ ``isofit_mode`` features. Both extend the joint design matrix to
``(B·N, B + 4 + 2·L)`` with shared higher-order columns; the
difference is when the wider solve fires:

- ``simultaneous_in_loop``: every iteration's joint solve uses the
  wider matrix. Geometry update reads ``coeffs[B..B+3]`` exactly as
  before — coefficient layout is unchanged at those indices.
- ``simultaneous_original``: standard 5-param iteration loop, then ONE
  wider joint solve over all orders runs after convergence (Ciambur
  2015 original variant).

Both modes emit a ``UserWarning`` at config construction citing
single-band benchmark concerns; validate carefully on PGC006669 and
asteris before trusting.

#### Validators

- ``shared`` / ``simultaneous_*`` × ``harmonic_combination='ref'``:
  hard-error. Ref-mode bypasses the joint solver entirely.
- ``shared`` / ``simultaneous_*`` × ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False``:
  silently allowed. Compose cleanly with the ring-mean intercept mode.
- ``shared`` / ``simultaneous_*`` × ``loose_validity=True``: silently
  allowed. The jagged builders ``build_joint_design_matrix_jagged`` and
  ``build_joint_design_matrix_jagged_higher`` carry the higher-order
  columns through the loose-validity path.

#### Performance bar (Stage-1 D17 / Section 6.1 Q11)

All four modes must stay within ≤ 2.5× single-band wall time on the
asteris perf benchmark. Measured on the B=5 768² cutout (2026-05-03):

| Configuration | Median (s) | Ratio vs SB |
|---|---:|---:|
| singleband (i-band) | 0.209 | 1.00× |
| multiband independent | 0.293 | 1.41× |
| multiband shared | 0.279 | 1.34× |
| multiband simultaneous_in_loop | 0.317 | 1.52× |
| multiband simultaneous_original | 0.272 | **1.30×** |

All four PASS. ``simultaneous_original`` is the cheapest non-default
mode because one post-hoc joint solve replaces ``B × L`` separate
``compute_deviations`` calls.

### Per-band intercept mode revisited (Section 6.12)

The boolean ``IsosterConfigMB.fit_per_band_intens_jointly`` (default
``True``, renamed from the deprecated
``fix_per_band_background_to_zero=False`` in the Section 6.12 cleanup)
governs how each isophote's per-band intercept ``I0_b`` is computed.
See the [Per-band intercept mode](#per-band-intercept-mode) section
above for the full mechanism description.

The two modes are **numerically equivalent on full rings** because
sin(nφ) and cos(nφ) are orthogonal to the constant column over [0, 2π].
They diverge only on partial rings (loose validity, masked sectors),
where the joint solve absorbs harmonic-shape coupling between bands.
This is when the joint mode adds information across bands relative to
a per-band ring statistic.

Sky correction is **not** part of the fit. The optional post-process
``subtract_outermost_sky_offset(result, n_outer=N)`` lives in
``isoster.multiband.plotting_mb`` and operates only on already-fit
results; it never modifies the fit. The library never invokes it
implicitly. Demo scripts call it explicitly between FITS write and
QA plot generation; raw FITS files always preserve the unmodified
``intens_<b>``.

### Outer-region regularization — damping mode (Stage-3 Stage-B)

Backport of the single-band ``outer_reg_*`` family in **damping**
mode. Use ``use_outer_center_regularization=True`` to enable a soft
Tikhonov-style step shrink in the LSB regime: per-iteration geometry
updates ``δ_param`` are multiplied by ``(1 - α(sma))``, where ``α``
ramps from 0 below ``outer_reg_sma_onset`` to a saturation set by
``outer_reg_strength``. Saturated clipped jumps in PA, ellipticity,
and center are suppressed; the fit still walks to its data-preferred
geometry — there is no pull toward the reference. The full Tikhonov
solver mode (with reference pull) lands in Stage E.

Six fields, mirroring single-band semantics:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ``use_outer_center_regularization`` | ``False`` | Master toggle. |
| ``outer_reg_sma_onset`` | ``50.0`` | Sigmoid midpoint (pixels). |
| ``outer_reg_strength`` | ``2.0`` | Saturation amplitude of the ramp. |
| ``outer_reg_weights`` | ``{center: 1, eps: 1, pa: 1}`` | Per-axis weights; default ``{1,1,1}`` damps all four geometry parameters and prevents the selector-asymmetry failure mode. |
| ``outer_reg_sma_width`` | ``None`` (auto = ``0.4 * onset``) | Sigmoid slope width. |
| ``outer_reg_ref_sma_factor`` | ``2.0`` | Inward isophotes within ``sma0 × factor`` feed the flux-weighted reference. |

The ``outer_reg_mode`` field is currently a one-value
``Literal["damping"]``. Stage E will widen it to
``Literal["damping", "solver"]`` and add the full Tikhonov
ref-pull. Users who set ``outer_reg_mode='solver'`` today get a
clear pydantic Literal validation error.

**Auto-enable.** With ``use_outer_center_regularization=True`` and
default ``geometry_convergence=False``, the validator emits a
``UserWarning`` and flips ``geometry_convergence=True`` automatically.
Without geometry convergence the fit runs to ``maxit`` on outer
isophotes with no change to recorded geometry — pure cost.
Suppress the warning by setting ``geometry_convergence=True``
explicitly.

**Sanity warnings.** The validator also emits warnings for:

- ``outer_reg_sma_onset < sma0`` (penalty fires from the first
  outward step; typical onset ~ ``sma0 * 3``).
- ``minsma >= sma0`` (no inward isophotes → reference falls back to
  the anchor's geometry).
- All ``outer_reg_weights`` zero (feature is inert).
- ``fix_<axis>=True`` with ``outer_reg_weights[<axis>]>0`` (axis is
  frozen so the penalty is identically zero).

**Reference geometry.** Built once per fit by
``_build_outer_reference_mb`` in the driver. Flux-weighted mean
(weights = ``intens_<reference_band>``) over inward isophotes with
``sma <= sma0 * outer_reg_ref_sma_factor`` plus the anchor; ``pa``
uses a circular mean on ``2*pa`` so axis-like angles around 0 and π
average sensibly. Falls back to the anchor's geometry if the inward
sweep is empty or all candidates fail finiteness checks.

**Asteris benchmark.**
``benchmarks/multiband/bench_outer_reg_damping_asteris.py`` compares
three configs (no outer-reg, center-only damper, all-axes damper) on
HSC g/r/i/z/y. Headline results (n_repeats=3, B=5, 768²):

| configuration | median (s) | ratio vs SB | outer eps MAD | outer pa MAD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| singleband (i-band) | 0.333 | 1.00× | — | — |
| baseline (no outer-reg) | 0.425 | 1.28× | 1.17e-01 | 9.19e-02 |
| damping center-only | 0.436 | 1.31× | 5.39e-02 | 0.00 |
| damping all axes (default) | 0.388 | **1.16×** | 9.93e-06 | 0.00 |

All PASS the ≤ 2.5× single-band bar. Damping-vs-baseline overhead
is **0.91×** — the all-axes damper is faster than baseline because
the auto-enabled ``geometry_convergence`` lets damped fits exit
earlier than the harmonic-only criterion does in the LSB regime.

### LSB auto-lock (Stage-3 Stage-C)

Backport of the single-band ``lsb_auto_lock`` family. Outward growth
starts in free-geometry mode; once the **joint combined gradient**
(plan section 7 S3) degrades — a relative joint gradient error
above ``lsb_auto_lock_maxgerr`` for ``lsb_auto_lock_debounce``
consecutive isophotes, OR a ``stop_code=-1``, OR a non-negative
joint gradient — the lock commits. Remaining outward isophotes
inherit the **shared geometry** of the anchor (the isophote
immediately *before* the streak) and switch to the configured
``lsb_auto_lock_integrator``. Inward growth and the central pixel
are untouched.

Four fields:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ``lsb_auto_lock`` | ``False`` | Master toggle. |
| ``lsb_auto_lock_maxgerr`` | ``0.3`` | Trigger threshold on \|grad_err / grad\| (joint scalars). Stricter than the free-fit ``maxgerr=0.5`` so the lock fires before a stop_code=-1 would have. |
| ``lsb_auto_lock_debounce`` | ``2`` | Consecutive triggered isophotes before commit. |
| ``lsb_auto_lock_integrator`` | ``'median'`` | Integrator used in the locked region. |

**Hard-error validators** (plan section 7.5 items 2–3):

1. ``lsb_auto_lock=True`` ∧ any of ``fix_center`` / ``fix_pa`` /
   ``fix_eps`` ⇒ ``ValueError``. The lock requires free geometry on
   the outward sweep (mirrors single-band).
2. ``lsb_auto_lock_integrator='median'`` ∧
   ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=True`` ⇒ ``ValueError``. The lock-
   fire path would clone the cfg with ``integrator='median'`` on a
   matrix-mode joint LS, which Stage-A's S1 rejects. **Default
   ``lsb_auto_lock_integrator='median'`` therefore requires the
   user to also set ``fit_per_band_intens_jointly=False`` when
   enabling the lock.** To use the matrix-mode joint solve with the
   lock, set ``lsb_auto_lock_integrator='mean'``.

**Soft warning + auto-enable.** ``lsb_auto_lock=True`` with
``debug=False`` (the default) emits a ``UserWarning`` and flips
``debug=True`` internally — the lock trigger reads top-level
``grad`` / ``grad_error`` row keys that the fitter only writes
under debug.

**Top-level result keys** (when ``lsb_auto_lock=True``):

- ``result['lsb_auto_lock']`` — ``True``.
- ``result['lsb_auto_lock_sma']`` — SMA of the trigger isophote
  (``None`` if the lock never committed).
- ``result['lsb_auto_lock_count']`` — number of isophotes carrying
  ``lsb_locked=True`` in their row dict.

**Per-isophote keys** (when ``lsb_auto_lock=True``):

- ``iso['lsb_locked']`` — ``True`` for outward isophotes after the
  lock fires (the trigger isophote and all subsequent), ``False``
  for the anchor and earlier isophotes.
- ``iso['lsb_auto_lock_anchor']`` — only set on the trigger isophote
  itself, marks the SMA at which the lock committed.

**Asteris benchmark.**
``benchmarks/multiband/bench_lsb_auto_lock_asteris.py`` compares
three configs (no lock, lock-mean, lock-median) on HSC g/r/i/z/y
(n_repeats=3, B=5, 768², 250k masked):

| configuration | median (s) | ratio vs SB | lock fires | lock SMA | n_locked | outer pa MAD |
|---|---:|---:|:---:|---:|---:|---:|
| singleband (i-band) | 0.219 | 1.00× | — | — | — | — |
| baseline (no lock) | 0.299 | 1.37× | no | — | 0 | 9.19e-02 |
| lock-mean | 0.280 | **1.28×** | yes | 238.4 | 9 | 6.31e-02 |
| lock-median | 0.313 | 1.43× | yes | 238.4 | 9 | **1.01e-02** |

All PASS the ≤ 2.5× single-band bar. ``lock-mean`` is actually
*faster* than ``baseline`` because the locked-region isophotes skip
the iteration loop (frozen geometry → forced photometry style).
Outer-tail PA MAD drops from 9.19e-02 (baseline) → 1.01e-02
(lock-median): the lock pins outer geometry at the clean anchor,
exactly the LSB stabilization the feature is designed for.

> **Galaxy-type caveat (2026-05-04).** The lock is designed for
> **massive ellipticals / cD galaxies with extended LSB envelopes**
> — the regime where the inner geometry is the best estimate of the
> outer envelope's geometry and a hard freeze is the right LSB

> "geometry tracked." Use the QA mosaics in
> ``outputs/benchmark_multiband/lsb_auto_lock_{asteris,pgc}/`` to
> read the trajectory, not just the scatter.

### Central-region geometry regularization (Stage-3 Stage-F)

Verbatim port of the single-band ``central_reg_*`` family. Geometry
is shared in multi-band, so the penalty is band-agnostic — no
per-band design choice. Set ``use_central_regularization=True`` to
add a Gaussian-decaying penalty to the best-iteration selector
(``effective_amp``):

```
λ(sma) = central_reg_strength · exp(-(sma / central_reg_sma_threshold)²)

penalty = λ · ( w_eps · Δeps²  +  w_pa · Δpa²  +  w_center · (Δx0² + Δy0²) )
```

where ``Δ*`` are the per-iteration changes from the previous
isophote's geometry. PA residual wraps onto ``[-π, π]`` (single-band
convention). The gate is ``λ < 1e-6`` (penalty becomes exactly
zero past ~3× the threshold SMA).

This is a **selector-layer** penalty — it does not modify the
harmonic step. Iterations whose geometry jumped far from the
previous isophote at low SMA look worse to the selector and are
not chosen as the new ``best_geometry``. Mechanically distinct from
``outer_reg_*`` damping (which step-shrinks the harmonic update)
and from ``lsb_auto_lock`` (which hard-freezes geometry).

Four fields:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ``use_central_regularization`` | ``False`` | Master toggle. |
| ``central_reg_sma_threshold`` | ``5.0`` | Gaussian decay scale (px). Penalty essentially zero beyond ~3× threshold. |
| ``central_reg_strength`` | ``1.0`` | Maximum strength at SMA=0. ``ge=0`` (zero is legal — feature on but inert). |
| ``central_reg_weights`` | ``{eps: 1, pa: 1, center: 1}`` | Per-axis weights. Unknown keys are rejected (validated unconditionally, even when the feature is off, to catch typos). |

Use case: stabilize fits in low-S/N central regions where the
harmonic amplitudes are noise-dominated and small geometry jumps
get amplified by ``coeff = (1-ε)/grad`` etc. The single-band
benchmark suite uses this on dim nuclei. Geometry is shared in
multi-band, so the penalty composes cleanly with all other
features (``loose_validity``, ``multiband_higher_harmonics``,
``outer_reg_*``, ``lsb_auto_lock``) without interaction validators.

### Forced-photometry mode (Stage-3 Stage-H)

Pass ``template_isophotes=...`` to ``fit_image_multiband`` to bypass
the iteration loop entirely and run forced multi-band extraction at
each template row's exact ``(sma, x0, y0, eps, pa)`` geometry.
Common workflow:

```python
from isoster import IsosterConfig, fit_image
from isoster.multiband import IsosterConfigMB, fit_image_multiband

# 1. Fit single-band on a deep band first.
sb_cfg = IsosterConfig(sma0=10.0, maxsma=384.0, astep=0.1, debug=True)
sb_result = fit_image(i_image, mask=mask, config=sb_cfg)

# 2. Pass the single-band result as a multi-band template.
mb_cfg = IsosterConfigMB(
    bands=["g", "r", "i", "z", "y"], reference_band="i",
    compute_cog=True,
)
mb_result = fit_image_multiband(
    [g_image, r_image, i_image, z_image, y_image],
    masks=mask, config=mb_cfg,
    template_isophotes=sb_result,
    variance_maps=[g_var, r_var, i_var, z_var, y_var],
)
```

**Use case:** the user wants per-band HSC profiles but is not yet
ready to trust the joint multi-band fit, OR specifically wants the
i-band geometry to drive everything. Forced mode runs the per-band
sampler once across the shared geometry and emits the standard
multi-band result-dict shape — more efficient than running
single-band ``B`` times since the geometry pre-resolution and per-
band sampling work happens in one pass.

**Distinct from `harmonic_combination='ref'`.** Ref-mode still runs
the iteration loop and lets the geometry walk under the reference
band's harmonic constraint. Forced mode bypasses the iteration loop
entirely — geometry is bit-identical to the input template. The
distinction matters when users invoke forced mode specifically
because they want guaranteed-pinned geometry from a separate fit.

**Accepted template-input forms:**

- A path to a Schema-1 multi-band FITS file (e.g. an earlier
  ``fit_image_multiband`` run saved via
  ``isophote_results_mb_to_fits``).
- A path to a single-band FITS file (single-band's
  ``isophote_results_to_fits`` output). Single-band templates work
  because Stage-H only needs the geometry columns.
- A multi-band result dict (``fit_image_multiband`` return value).
- A single-band result dict (``fit_image`` return value).
- A list of dicts with ``sma`` / ``x0`` / ``y0`` / ``eps`` / ``pa``
  keys.

The list is sorted by ``sma`` ascending before extraction. ``sma=0``
rows dispatch to ``_fit_central_pixel_mb`` (per-band central
record); other rows dispatch to ``extract_forced_photometry_mb``
(per-band ring extraction).

**Validators (warn-and-ignore).** When ``template_isophotes`` is
provided, the iteration-loop-only features are no-ops and emit a
single ``UserWarning`` listing what was ignored:

- ``lsb_auto_lock=True``
- ``use_outer_center_regularization=True``
- ``use_central_regularization=True``
- ``harmonic_combination='ref'``

These features all live inside the iteration loop; forced mode
skips that loop. ``compute_cog=True`` is fully legal — in fact the
primary use case on top of forced extraction (per-band CoG against
fixed geometry).

**Output schema** matches the standard multi-band schema with all
geometry columns carrying the template values exactly. Two extra
top-level keys signal the workflow:

- ``result['forced_photometry_mode']`` — ``True``.
- ``result['template_n_isophotes']`` — count of input rows.

Per-band ``intens_<b>`` / ``intens_err_<b>`` come from
``extract_forced_photometry_mb`` per template SMA.

**Per-band harmonic deviations are computed (Stage-H.1, 2026-05-04).**
When ``compute_deviations=True`` (the default), the orchestrator
runs a second pass after the per-row sampling to fill the per-band
harmonic columns ``a<n>_<b>`` / ``b<n>_<b>`` (and their error
variants) for every order in ``harmonic_orders``. The per-band
gradient required by the Bender normalization comes from
``np.gradient(intens_<b>_col, sma_col)`` over the full template —
neighbor-derived per-band gradients, the same fallback the audit
pipeline uses on tools that ship no usable ``grad`` column. Ring
data is captured during the first pass via the helper's
``return_ring_data=True`` flag, so harmonic computation does not
re-sample the rings. Set ``compute_deviations=False`` to skip the
harmonic-fill pass and keep the columns zero (the original
Stage-H behavior, matching single-band's forced-photometry
convention).

### Per-band curve-of-growth (Stage-3 Stage-D)

Set ``compute_cog=True`` to enable per-band cumulative-flux
photometry. The driver runs once over the assembled isophote list
(ascending sma) after the inward + outward sweeps complete and
stamps the following columns onto each row dict — and thereby into
the Schema-1 ``ISOPHOTES`` table, since
``Table(rows=isophotes)`` auto-infers columns from the row dicts:

| Column | Per-band? | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| ``cog_<b>`` | yes | Cumulative flux through this isophote in band ``b`` (sum of annular fluxes from the central pixel out). |
| ``cog_annulus_<b>`` | yes | Annular flux at this isophote in band ``b`` (``intens_avg_<b> × area_annulus``). |
| ``area_annulus`` | no | Annular area (px²); shared because geometry is shared. Negative-annulus entries (isophote crossing) are zero-clamped. |
| ``flag_cross`` | no | Boolean; True where the geometry indicates a potential ellipse crossing. |
| ``flag_negative_area`` | no | Boolean; True where the raw annular area went negative before clamping. |

The shared columns mirror single-band semantics. Per-band columns
are unique to multi-band and use each band's ``intens_<b>``
trapezoidal-averaged across the inner / outer ring of the annulus
(the first annulus uses the innermost isophote's ``intens_<b>``
alone). NaN ``intens_<b>`` (e.g. a band dropped under
``loose_validity=True`` at a given isophote) propagates into
``cog_annulus_<b>`` / ``cog_<b>`` for that row — by design, so
downstream consumers can detect band-drops.

The B=1 multi-band CoG is bit-identical to the single-band CoG when
``intens_<b>`` matches the single-band ``intens`` (verified in
``tests/multiband/test_fitting_mb.py:test_compute_cog_mb_b1_matches_single_band_per_band_column``).

Schema-1 stays additive: when ``compute_cog=False`` (the default)
the new columns do not appear at all, and existing FITS files
round-trip unchanged. The plan-section 7 S7 decision (per-band
columns in the main per-isophote table, NOT a separate HDU) means
``compute_cog=True`` adds ``B × 2 + 3`` extra columns (e.g. 13
columns for B=5 HSC). The Schema-2 motivation if this becomes too
heavy is recorded in the plan doc.

## Testing

Multi-band tests live under `tests/multiband/` (264 total, all green
as of the Phase-39 + review-pass merge). The per-module counts below
are approximate (collected at merge time):

| Module | Cases | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `test_config_mb.py` | ~96 | band-name regex, duplicate detection, reference-band membership, band_weights validation, integrator restriction, SMA/iteration consistency, loose-validity field defaults + normalization compatibility, multiband_higher_harmonics enum (4 values + parametrized variants), harmonic_orders validator (empty / <3 / duplicates / unique-sort), simultaneous_* experimental warning, shared-mode no-warn, ring-mean intercept × ref-mode incompatibility, Stage-3 fields (outer_reg / lsb_auto_lock / central_reg / compute_cog / forced-photometry validators). |
| `test_sampling_mb.py` | ~19 | B=1 numerical parity with single-band sampler, shared-validity (per-band masks, NaN), variance sanitization (NaN/inf → 1e30, non-positive clamped + warning), all-masked degeneracy, mask broadcasting, variance all-or-nothing rejection, joint design matrix kernel parity. |
| `test_fitting_mb.py` | ~82 | joint solver recovery, B=1 single-band parity, WLS exact covariance, band-weight scaling, per-band sigma clip + AND, planted-galaxy recovery, ref-mode fallback, forced photometry, ring-mean intercept mode, loose-validity (band drop / n_valid columns / normalization), Stage-3 features (median intercept, outer-reg damping, lsb_auto_lock state machine, compute_cog wiring, central-reg penalty, forced-mode end-to-end + warn-list), **review-pass regressions** (B1 OLS rescale, B2 forced warn-list extensions, B3 forced-mode `grad_<b>`, H1 config immutability, H3 central-pixel WLS error, H4 SEM scaling). |
| `test_higher_harmonics.py` | ~20 | All four enum values; per-band-equality of shared higher orders; planted-m=4 recovery (shared + simultaneous_*); loose-validity × simultaneous (jagged kernel); simultaneous_original ≈ shared within tolerance; experimental UserWarning; FITS round-trip; harmonic_orders=[3,4,5,6] writes 16 expected per-band columns; D16 normalization separates curves under sharing; direct solver-level fit_simultaneous_joint{,_loose} planted-recovery. |
| `test_driver_mb.py` | ~17 | B=1 → single-band delegation, B=2 end-to-end recovery, WLS variance-mode tagging, band_weights passthrough, ref-mode end-to-end, error paths. |
| `test_utils_mb.py` | ~14 | FITS Schema-1 round-trip (per-band columns, loose validity, WLS variance mode, compute_cog), PrimaryHDU multi-band keywords, ASDF round-trip (Stage I — per-band columns, IsosterConfigMB recovery, compute_cog, lsb_auto_lock metadata, import guard), `load_bands_from_hdus`. |
| `test_plotting_mb.py` | 5 | Composite QA renders without exception, with SB constants, missing-bands error, image-count mismatch, loose-validity n_valid panel. |
| `test_cli_mb.py` | 10 | Stage-J: smoke runs (FITS / CSV / ASDF), banner output + `--quiet`, YAML-only bands, `--template` forced-photometry geometry parity, error paths (missing `--bands`, mismatched counts, `--reference-band` not in `--bands`, `--mask`/`--masks` mutual exclusion). |
