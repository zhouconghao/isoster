"""
Multi-band isoster configuration (``IsosterConfigMB``).

Sibling of :class:`isoster.config.IsosterConfig` with a deliberately
reduced field set, plus multi-band-only fields. There is **no
inheritance** between the two classes: changes to ``IsosterConfig`` do
not propagate automatically. This is intentional — the multi-band path
is experimental and we want it free to evolve independently of the
stable single-band path. See
``docs/agent/plan-2026-04-29-multiband-feasibility.md`` (decision D23)
for the rationale.

Excluded fields (deliberately not copied; Stage 2+ may add multi-band
variants):

- ``simultaneous_harmonics`` and ``isofit_mode`` (single-band ISOFIT
  API; the multi-band lift uses the ``multiband_higher_harmonics``
  enum instead, see plan section 6).
- All ``lsb_auto_lock_*`` fields
- All ``outer_reg_*`` and ``use_outer_center_regularization`` fields
- ``compute_cog`` (multi-band CoG attachment is out of Stage-1 scope)
- ``central_reg_*`` (single-band-only LSB knobs)
- ``lsb_sma_threshold`` and the ``adaptive`` integrator option
